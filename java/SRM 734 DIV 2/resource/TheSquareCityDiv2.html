<html><body bgcolor="#000000" text="#ffffff"><table><tr><td colspan="2"><h3>Problem Statement</h3></td></tr><tr><td>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</td><td>John and Brus have found a nice horizontal plane and they built a square city somewhere on the plane.
The city has n rows and n columns of houses.
More precisely, John and Brus built a house at each lattice point (x, y) such that 0 &le; x, y &lt; n.
<br></br><br></br>

The winter is coming.
Different houses have different heating systems and thus the temperatures inside them are distinct.
You are given the int[] <b>t</b> with n*n elements.
The temperature inside the house at (x, y) is <b>t</b>[x*n + y] degrees.
<br></br><br></br>

Outside there is a lot of snow and the only paths in the snow are along coordinate axes.
Thus, moving from the house at (x1, y1) to the house at (x2, y2) takes |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2| minutes.
Additionally, it's freezing outside, so a person can only stay outside for at most <b>r</b> consecutive minutes.
<br></br><br></br>

Initially there is exactly one person living in each house.
Each person then repeats the following process: They find the warmest house they can reach in a single trip, and they move there.
The people repeat the action until there is no warmer house within <b>r</b> minutes of travel from their current house.
<br></br><br></br>

Find two values:
<ul>
<li>a = the number of houses that will contain at least one person once everyone stops moving</li>
<li>b = the maximal number of people who will share the same house</li>
</ul>

Return a int[] with exactly two elements: {a, b}.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><h3>Definition</h3></td></tr><tr><td>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</td><td><table><tr><td>Class:</td><td>TheSquareCityDiv2</td></tr><tr><td>Method:</td><td>find</td></tr><tr><td>Parameters:</td><td>int, int[]</td></tr><tr><td>Returns:</td><td>int[]</td></tr><tr><td>Method signature:</td><td>int[] find(int r, int[] t)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">(be sure your method is public)</td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><h3>Limits</h3></td></tr><tr><td>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</td><td><table><tr><td>Time limit (s):</td><td>2.000</td></tr><tr><td>Memory limit (MB):</td><td>256</td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><h3>Constraints</h3></td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top">-</td><td>n will be between 1 and 20, inclusive.</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top">-</td><td><b>r</b> will be between 1 and 40, inclusive.</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top">-</td><td><b>t</b> will contain exactly n*n elements.</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top">-</td><td>Each element of <b>t</b> will be between 1 and 1,000, inclusive.</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top">-</td><td>All elements of <b>t</b> will be distinct.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><h3>Examples</h3></td></tr><tr><td align="center" nowrap="true">0)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</td><td><table><tr><td><table><tr><td><pre>1</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>{

The person from house 3 will first move to house 5 and then to house 9.
